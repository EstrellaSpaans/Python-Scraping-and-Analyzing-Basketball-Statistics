# Scraping and Analyzing Basketball Statistics with Python Basics
## IBM Capstone Project 

In this Jupiter Notebook, I created the following:
1. Defined a Web Scraping Function, returning a dictionary corresponding to the Regular season statistics of each basketball player scraped from m en.wikipedia.org. The Formal Parameter or input link is going to be the URL of the Wikipedia page for each player. 
1. Web-scraped the data and converted the links to Pandas Dataframes.
1. Plot the Points per game for a player using the function plt.plot().
